    "Precision and recall are two important metrics used to evaluate the performance of classification models, especially in the context of binary classification (where there are two classes: positive and negative).\n",
    "\n",
    "Precision:\n",
    "\n",
    "Precision is a measure of the accuracy of the positive predictions made by a model. It answers the question: \"Of all the instances predicted as positive, how many are actually positive?\"\n",
    "Mathematically, precision is calculated as the number of true positives (correctly predicted positive instances) divided by the sum of true positives and false positives (instances wrongly predicted as positive).\n",
    "Precision = TP / (TP + FP)\n",
    "A high precision indicates that the model has a low false positive rate, meaning that when it predicts positive, it is likely to be correct.\n",
    "Recall (Sensitivity or True Positive Rate):\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall measures the ability of a model to capture all the positive instances. It answers the question: \"Of all the actual positive instances, how many were correctly predicted by the model?\"\n",
    "Mathematically, recall is calculated as the number of true positives divided by the sum of true positives and false negatives (instances wrongly predicted as negative).\n",
    "Recall = TP / (TP + FN)\n",
    "High recall indicates that the model is good at identifying most of the positive instances, minimizing false negatives.\n",
    "These two metrics are often in tension with each other – improving one might degrade the other. This trade-off is important and can be visualized using a precision-recall curve. Depending on the specific problem and its requirements, you might prioritize precision over recall or vice versa.\n",
    "\n",
    "Precision-Recall Trade-off:\n",
    "Increasing the threshold for classifying instances as positive typically increases precision but decreases recall, and vice versa.\n",
    "A higher threshold makes the model more conservative in predicting positive instances, leading to fewer false positives but potentially missing some true positives.\n",
    "A lower threshold increases the likelihood of predicting positive instances, which may improve recall but at the cost of more false positives."
